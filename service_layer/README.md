## Service Details

### 1) YOLO

- Directory: `Services/YOLO`
- Purpose: YOLO-based object detection with D435i depth data for object distance estimation.
- Typical use cases: online perception, object localization, and detection input for grasping/navigation.
- Source: [https://github.com/killnice/yolov5-D435i.git](https://github.com/killnice/yolov5-D435i.git)

### 2) GraspAnything

- Directory: `Services/GraspAnything`
- Purpose: Provides grasp-task-related detection and inference capabilities.
- Typical use cases: candidate target selection and pre-grasp perception for robot manipulation.
- Source: [https://github.com/graspnet/anygrasp_sdk.git](https://github.com/graspnet/anygrasp_sdk.git)

### 3) VLAC

- Directory: `Services/VLAC`
- Purpose: Provides Vision-Language-Action critic capabilities for task progress evaluation, completion judgment, and trajectory quality scoring.
- Typical use cases: reinforcement learning reward estimation, task execution monitoring, and trajectory data filtering.
- Source: [https://github.com/InternRobotics/VLAC.git](https://github.com/InternRobotics/VLAC.git)

### 4) SpatialMemory

- Directory: `Services/SpatialMemory`
- Purpose: Unified memory service for object memory, place memory, semantic frame memory, and keyframe memory, with query APIs.
- Typical use cases: long-term robot memory, target recall/localization, and task-context retrieval.

### 5) LAP

- Directory: `Services/LAP`
- Purpose: Wraps the official `lihzha/lap` websocket policy server and `lihzha/LAP-3B` checkpoint for PiPER action-preview inference.
- Typical use cases: live shadow action generation and one bounded LAP-driven PiPER proof-of-concept action.
- Source: [https://github.com/lihzha/lap](https://github.com/lihzha/lap)
